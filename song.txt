California knows how to party, California knows how to party
In the city of L.A, in the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sexWe in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat
The state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money makin' machines, servin' fiendsI been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin' lookin' like I robbed Liberace
I saw you down the neighbourhood
And I understood
Spiritual hangover that I can't shake
It's getting more then I can take
And in this restless disfigured place
We've only got each other

I just wanna go blur the line
And leave our afflictions behind
The sky is coming down
I know it's strange
But heaven's a mindset away
